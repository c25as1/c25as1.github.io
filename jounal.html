		I have just finished coding sections of a soccer goal to link to my journal, projects, and about me pages. It is a bit frustrating because coding takes forever, but it is also exciting to see the website coming together. During this process I have solidified the basics and I am starting to learn new things like how to have two divs next to each other. For the next week or two I want to clean up my homepage, and spend some time on the other pages (journal, about me, projects).

		Today I worked on my journal page and the home page. I put my journal entry that I wrote in google docs in the journal page as well as adding dates, and a title. Another thing that I added to the journal page is a background color. On the home page, I moved around the words so that they are in a better place.

		Today I made an animation this was a bit difficult but I used w3 to help me. The frustrating part was I was not able to get one of my images to work so I will be asking Molly about that.

		Today I worked on making my website coherent. In doing this, and I changed my homepage quite a bit. I put in a new image for a goal that worked better with a light blue background. I also change the background color of my about me page, projects page, and journal page. I was able to make a code sketch for a function. I also added a bit to my project page so it would link to one of my projects but I still have to add my other projects to the projects page. Currently I am working on learning more about JavaScript and I am doing this with code sketches. Another thing that I am working on is trying to make the cursor on my homepage a soccer ball.

		Today I made a codescetch of a color change animation. I used the checklist Molly provided us with to figure out what I needed to work on and meant working on animations. I made the cursor on my homepage a soccerball, but whenever I scroled up the ball would not be alligned with the cursor and I wasn't able to click on things so I decided to get rid of the cursor and I will work on it later.

		Today I made a codesketch of different fonts. Like the last journal entry, I used the checklist Molly provided us with to figure out what I needed to work on and meant working on fonts. I made a codesketch explaining how to make text different fonts. This is a project I can continue working on because I was only able to do two fonts to start, so I can continue adding more fonts. I also attached this codesketch to my projects page.

		Today I made a code sketch to practice JavaScript. This code sketch is a ice cream drawing page. I used a JavaScript function to create divs of ice cream cones that follow my cursor. I did run into some difficulties when coding, but I later figured out that it was because I had used " instead of '.

		It's been a while since I updated my website, but I have constantly been working on it in the background without pushing it. Between now in my last journal entry, and I was working on my data representation project. This project is based on the amount of time I spent on my phone and what apps I use the most. If you go to my projects page you can check that out. In addition to this project, I have been trying to rework my project page because right now it works but the code is quite complicated and I would love to simplify the coding aspect of it to make it easier to add new projects to it. Two of my goals are to get better at pushing my code often and working on more projects in less time.
