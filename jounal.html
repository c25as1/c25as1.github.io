		I have just finished coding sections of a soccer goal to link to my journal, projects, and about me pages. It is a bit frustrating because coding takes forever, but it is also exciting to see the website coming together. During this process I have solidified the basics and I am starting to learn new things like how to have two divs next to each other. For the next week or two I want to clean up my homepage, and spend some time on the other pages (journal, about me, projects).

		Today I worked on my journal page and the home page. I put my journal entry that I wrote in google docs in the journal page as well as adding dates, and a title. Another thing that I added to the journal page is a background color. On the home page, I moved around the words so that they are in a better place.
